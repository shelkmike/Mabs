#! /usr/bin/env bash

<<COMMENT
This script compiles additional programs provided with Mabs.
Just run "bash install.sh" .

The folder "Additional_src" contains the source code of programs used by Mabs. When "bash install.sh" is run, the content of this folder is copied into the folder "Additional" and then compiled there. Keeping the non-compiled code in a separate folder allows for a simple re-installion of Mabs in case some problem happens during installation. To re-install Mabs, one may just run "bash install.sh" again. This command deletes the folder "Additional", then re-creates it and re-compiles everything.

#Installing Modified_hifiasm. It is a special version of Hifiasm made for Mabs. Compared to the ordinary Hifiasm, it has an additional option "--only-primary" that forces an assembly to terminate after the GFA file with primary contigs has been made. This preliminary termination allows to save some time if only primary contigs are needed.
